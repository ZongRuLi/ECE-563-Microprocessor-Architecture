# Microprocessor Architecture

## project 1: Cache Design, Memory Hierarchy Design (C++)
- Designed a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator to simulate different cache sizes, associations, hierarchies.
- Developed caches with LRU (least-recently-used) replacement policy and WBWA (write-back + write-allocate) policy.
- Implemented victim cache between L1 and L2 cache to decrease L1 cache miss rate.

## project 2: Branch Prediction (C++)
## project 3: Dynamic Instruction Scheduling (C++)

### Note: Project 4, 5, 6, 7 is based on a OOO(out-of-order) superscalar microarchitecture

## project 4: ILP Limit Study (C++)
## project 5: Register File and Renaming (C++)
- Implemented AMT(Architectural Map Table), RMT(Rename Map Table), Active List, Free List, PRF(Physical Register File) to rename register and read register value.
- Implemented GBM(Global Branch Mask), Branch Checkpoints to resolve and recover branch.
