# Microprocessor Architecture

## project 1: Cache Design, Memory Hierarchy Design (C++)
- Designed a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator to simulate different cache sizes, associations, hierarchies.
- Developed caches with LRU (least-recently-used) replacement policy and WBWA (write-back + write-allocate) policy.
- Implemented victim cache between L1 and L2 cache to decrease L1 cache miss rate.
